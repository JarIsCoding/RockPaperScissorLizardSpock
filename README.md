Peer review - The website is technically functional, but is quite buggy. The rules button at the very start is non-functional. The First to 1 for both pvp and pve is scuffed, with the round counter going from 0/1 to 1/0 and occasionally requiring more than 1 point to get the "Go back" prompt. The First to Five is also bugged, as the breaking point of 7 rounds should be 4 points, not 5. This means rounds can go up to 9. Inside the matches, there is what seems to be an extra rock symbol at the top of all the symbols, which is unnecessary.
